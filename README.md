# ‚ôªÔ∏èPIC-Waste-Management-Bin-
This project is a smart waste management system using the PIC16F877A microcontroller. It sorts waste with an inductive sensor for metals and an IR sensor for other materials, using a servo to direct items into the correct bin. A Sharp IR sensor monitors the bin's fill level, displaying status on an LCD and activating a buzzer when full. A push button triggers a bin emptying mode. The system promotes efficient, automated waste handling.


## üìò Project Overview

The Smart Waste Management System is an embedded project built using the **PIC16F877A** microcontroller. It automates waste detection, sorting, and bin level monitoring to encourage efficient and eco-friendly disposal practices. This system combines sensors, a servo motor, and a display interface to create an intelligent solution for managing household or public waste bins.

### üîß Key Functions:

- **Waste Type Detection:**
  - Inductive sensor detects metallic objects.
  - IR sensor identifies non-metallic/general waste.

- **Automated Sorting:**
  - Servo motor rotates to guide waste into the correct bin based on sensor input.

- **Bin Fill Monitoring:**
  - Sharp IR sensor checks the fill level of the bin.
  - LCD shows real-time system status.
  - Buzzer alerts when the bin is full.

- **User Interaction:**
  - Push button triggers an interrupt to simulate bin emptying and reset system status.

This project showcases how simple electronics and microcontroller logic can be used to solve real-world problems in sustainability and automation. It‚Äôs ideal for learning embedded systems and building environmentally conscious solutions.
